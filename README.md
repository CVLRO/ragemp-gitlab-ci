# RageMP GitlabCI Configuration for ragemp server (without build)

How to run : 

1. Install gitlab runner from https://docs.gitlab.com/runner/ on your server and configure it with your repo
2. Add gitlab-runner to sudoers and make it passwordless :        
```sudo usermod -a -G sudo gitlab-runner && sudo sh -c "echo \"gitlab-runner ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL\" >> /etc/sudoers"```
3. Add server/.gitlab-ci.yml to your gitlab repository

The create.sh file will generate and register a systemd service so you can use service ragemp start/stop/status/restart and restart your server automatically if it crashes. (you can also set the service name to a custom one)

There will be also a build system for client_packages for npm soon.

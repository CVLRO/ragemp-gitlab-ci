# Read README.md at https://github.com/CVLRO/ragemp-gitlab-ci for usage instructions

stages: 
  # - build
  # - test
  - deploy

variables:
# replace ragemp with the name of the service you want to use for your server
  SERVICE_NAME: ragemp
# this is the npm package for the client_packages of your server
  NPM_CLIENT: cvlrp-dev
# SERVER_PATH is in the gitlab secret variables in my case, you can put it here too or in secret variables

# The deploy_staging handles the deployment of a development server on the server on which you installed gitlab-runner

deploy_staging:
# remove the 2 lines below if you want to run the lower development build on other branches than devel
  only: 
    - devel
  script: 
    # eval is used instead of wrapping commands with "", do not use '' because variables won't be parsed
    # Uncomment export if some variable doesn't work
    #  - export
    
    # Download latest ragemp server
     - "[ ! -f server ] && wget https://cdn.rage.mp/lin/server"
     
    # Download create.sh script from my repo, which creates a systemd service and sets it up
    # Also the systemd service will restart your server if it crashes
     - eval wget https://raw.githubusercontent.com/CVLRO/create-systemd-service/master/create.sh
     
    # Create systemd service with $SERVICE_NAME as its name so you can use service ragemp start/status/stop/restart for example
     - eval sudo chmod +x create.sh && sudo ./create.sh $SERVICE_NAME "$SERVER_PATH/server --inspect" 'RageMP test server'
     
     # Clean the server directory from create.sh
     - eval sudo rm create.sh
     
    # The line below will get a public npm build with yarn of your clientside code and rename it into client_packages (disabled by default)
    #  - eval yarn add $NPM_CLIENT && mv $NPM_CLIENT client_packages
    
    # Check if server path exists, delete it, then recreate it and copy the files in the gitlab build directory to where it will run
     - eval [ -e $SERVER_PATH ] && sudo rm -rf $SERVER_PATH && mkdir $SERVER_PATH && cp -R * $SERVER_PATH/ && chmod +x $SERVER_PATH/server
    
    # Restart/start the server if it is not running
     - eval service $SERVICE_NAME restart
  stage: deploy


# The deploy_prod handles the deployment of the production server, you are free to customize it to your needs, it must be manually
# run from gitlab

deploy_prod: 
  only: 
    - master
  script: 
    # Modify everything here to your needs for deployment to production
    # - eval [ ! -f server ] && wget https://cdn.rage.mp/lin/server
    
    # - copy the conf.prod.json (which has default port and is announced) to conf.json (which by default should
    # be the development config and has a special port and not announced)
    - eval [ -e conf.json ] && [ -e conf.prod.json ] && mv conf.prod.json conf.json
    
    #  - 'eval service ragemp-prod restart '
